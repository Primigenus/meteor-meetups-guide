# A guide to organising Meteor Meetups

## Abstract

This document is intended to help Meteor meetup Captains and attendees structure meetups so that they become successful recurring events. It is written and maintained by Meteor Captains who have experience organising and hosting such meetups and should continue to grow and change based on those experiences.

This document is not a guide to learn Meteor; those already exist and do a fantastic job at guiding new users through the challenges of learning a new paradigm. Instead, we should focus on the organisational element around social Meteor-related gatherings by identifying and listing best practices and collecting great new ideas from around the community.

This document should update and eventually replace Jade&rsquo;s original &quot;[Some Notes to New Captains](https://docs.google.com/a/q42.nl/document/d/1kiQxDJSQnbnFp4UTd48Ac-tFuUtYWITHLsf-UDuDdjY/edit)&quot;.

In writing this document, we were inspired by and want to thank the following similar documents from other communities:

*   [RailsGirls Guides](http://guides.railsgirls.com/)
*   [Ansible Meetup Organizer](http://www.ansible.com/ansible-meetup-organizer)

## Why make this?

After roughly 2 years of Meteor meetups, we&rsquo;re starting to identify what works well at Meteor meetups. The number of meetups is increasing, new Captains are everywhere, and collecting and organizing our thoughts on several meetup-related topics should help in the future. The most important aspect of this document should be that it is written and maintained by active Captains and contributed to by attendees.

## Welcome to the community, Captain

Welcome and thanks for shouldering the responsibility/taking up the mantle/wearing the cowl of the Meteor Captain! Or is that Captain Meteor?

Anyway, we&rsquo;re glad to have you. Being a Captain for Meteor is a lot of work, but it&rsquo;s extremely gratifying, puts you in touch with brilliant people, and most importantly, makes you even better at Meteor.

The first thing you should do when you join is let everyone know you&rsquo;re here! The best way to do that is to email the meteor-captains Google Group, which you should have been introduced to. If not, it&rsquo;s [meteor-captains@googlegroups.com](https://meteor-captains@googlegroups.com). If you can&rsquo;t post to it, contact a friendly Captain or let Yuriy know and they can hook you up.

With introductions out of the way, we&rsquo;ve taken the time to gather up some things we think will be helpful for new Captains. Have a read, and if you see anything you&rsquo;d like to change or something you want to add, go ahead! This document should live and breathe the Captains&rsquo; POVs, after all.

**Things new Captains should know**
**Meteor community hotspots**

Knowing where people hang out and ask questions about Meteor will help you keep up to date with issues and concerns in the community as well as new announcements, packages, startups and other third party software using Meteor. We recommend the below places to come back to regularly:

*   [Meteor roadmap](https://roadmap.meteor.com)
    The official MDG roadmap for Meteor. It&rsquo;s good to have a general idea of what was recently released (left-most column), what&rsquo;s coming soon, and what people are really anxious to get their hands on (check the comments on each card).

*   [Crater.io](https://crater.io)
    Launched by Josh Owens, creators of Meteor Podcast and author of Testing Meteor, this is a Telescope-based &quot;Hacker News&quot; clone for Meteorites!

*   [Kadira Hub](https://hub.kadira.io)
    Another Telescope-based forum for discussing Meteor, specifically focused on performance-related issues and concerns. A partner site to the incredible live metrics app [Kadira](https://kadira.io) by Arunoda.

*   meteorjs IRC channel
    Lurking here gives you a good idea of what Meteor newbies are coming across.

*   meteor-talk &amp; meteor-core
    meteor-talk is the MDG-supported newsgroup for everything Meteor. At this point there&rsquo;s a lot of noise, but setting it to be emailed as a digest allows you to give it a quick glance once a week to see what&rsquo;s going on.
    meteor-core is where discussion between developers and MDG happens about critical elements of Meteor, and where you&rsquo;ll find announcements of early alphas, betas, and release candidates of the next version of Meteor.

*   [Stack Overflow meteor tag](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/meteor)
    Check out this tag to get a sense of what issues Meteor developers are dealing with in real-time, or take a look at the most upvoted and most active questions for a comprehensive view of the burning questions you&rsquo;re likely to hear at your first meetup :-)
    It also pays off to dive in and help out on here as you&rsquo;ll build a network and get really good at answering recurring questions.

*   [Github](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues) issues
    Bugs and patches for Meteor are generally reported here and this can be a good place to check just after a new release in case some hairy things are going on.

*   [Meteor Forums](https://forums.meteor.com/)
    Official meteor forums, meteor-talk and meteor-core are no longer official forums.
The team has put years of work into designing exactly the kind of collaborative forum we need for our community. 
Like Stack Overflow, relies on a reputation system and community moderation to keep the quality level high.  

When you post a new topic, please put it in the right category. [Categories](https://forums.meteor.com/categories)
No one likes spam, so take this in consideration before just posting here.

If you need the answer to a technical question about how to do something in Meteor, the best place to start is Stack Overflow, a popular programming question and answer site. Stack Overflow is designed to help make sure answers to popular questions stay up to date as Meteor changes, so we try to steer most technical Q&A there.

To contribute bug reports and patches to the Meteor core itself, the right place is our GitHub6 repository. Before you post a bug or patch, please first read the [Contributing to Meteor guidelines](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Contributing-to-Meteor)

**Resources in the Meteor community**

Knowing what&rsquo;s going on in the community is one step, but it&rsquo;s also important to have an up-to-date sense of what the best resources are for learning Meteor and getting better at it. Many software developers will be transitioning from a different platform to Meteor, but you should also keep in mind there will be plenty of fresh faces starting out with programming with Meteor, as well as more experienced devs looking to hone and improve their skills. Here are some resources you can refer them to:

*   [Official Meteor docs](http://docs.meteor.com/) and [unofficial Meteor FAQ](https://github.com/oortcloud/unofficial-meteor-faq)

*   <u>[Discover Meteor](http://www.discovermeteor.com/)</u>, by Tom Coleman and Sacha Greif
    Comprehensive ebook for all levels, assumes some prior JavaScript/programming experience

*   <u>[How to Learn JavaScript Properly](http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/)</u>, by Richard Bovell
    Learning roadmaps for JavaScript beginners and first-time programmers

*   [Meteor Academy](https://meteor.academy), by [Ciara Burkett](/ep/profile/sIuAp0daDya)
    A great resource by a fellow Captain who&rsquo;s also new to programming and Meteor

**I&rsquo;m not a Captain but I&rsquo;d like to be!**

If you&rsquo;re interested in becoming a Captain, you&rsquo;ve already taken the first step by being involved enough to read this document! Get in touch with any of the MDG Community team members below, or approach your favourite Captain, and we can go from there. This is a pretty informal group of people trying to do what they can for the community, so we&rsquo;ll&nbsp; welcome you with open arms. :)

**Meet the MDG Community team**

The Meteor Community, Captains, and meetups are supported by a dedicated team at MDG (Meteor Development Group, the company behind Meteor). Over time you&rsquo;ll probably interface with a lot of Meteor&rsquo;s team, including the core devs, but here are some names you&rsquo;ll likely come across more often:

*   [Alice](https://twitter.com/yaliceme)
    Alice is a Community Manager at MDG and, beyond being super friendly, also handles social media stuff.

*   [Yuriy](https://twitter.com/html5cat)
    Yuriy is a Community Engineer and will probably be someone you talk to a lot about operational things like running a meetup, getting swag, etc. (Fun fact: Yuriy used to be a Captain too!)

*   [Robert](https://twitter.com/rdickert)
    Robert is a Community Engineer who is runs Meteor&rsquo;s speaker program. He is interested in promoting talks by the community to non-Meteor meetups (e.g., js, Rails, Mongodb, Mobile, Front End, Novice, etc.). He can help you find places to speak and can help you with getting your presentation ready. (Fun fact: Robert is still captain of Meteor Boulder and helped found the Velocity testing project!)

**Meet the other Captains**

*   The [meteor-captains Google Group](https://meteor-captains@googlegroups.com)

    As a Captain, you&rsquo;ll be added to the Google Group. Feel free to introduce yourself, ask us anything, and make sure to share when you do something cool!

## Your first meetup

**What makes a good meetup?**

*   **Good venue&nbsp;**

    *   Right size&nbsp; - cosy and full is better than huge and empty
    *   Good acoustics - can people hear the speaker, can people talk without distracting others?)
    *   _feng shui_ (You&rsquo;re gonna struggle to have a good event in a bad space)

*   **<s>&nbsp;Good&nbsp;</s> people**

    *   The more the merrier. Good ones if you can but you can&rsquo;t be picky ;-) You can have a great meetup with a handful of friends, but it&rsquo;s really nice to watch a meetup grow.
    *   Have an interesting subject (Mobile, Testing, Security, Performance are good ones)
    *   Promote it.

*   **YOU**

Most important. I&rsquo;m not gonna lie. It&rsquo;s on you. As content provider &amp; compère you really tie the room together. If you&rsquo;re new to this, it&rsquo;ll be fine, but you may have to level up at...

*   **Public speaking**

_&quot;If you want to level up you have to fight monsters.&quot; _Best to assume that no one cares that you&rsquo;re scared of it and just get on with it. Everyone who turns up is there to learn something, meet people like you, and they want you to guide things. If you&rsquo;re having a good time, chances are they will.

*   **_Be nice to people!&nbsp;_**

Sounds obvious but it&rsquo;s super important. Meeting new people is hard, and simple things like introducing yourself to everyone personally as they arrive can go along way to remembering names and making people feel welcome. You build community by putting yourself out there.

*   **Do your homework**

If you&rsquo;re expecting people to bring talks and demos, you need to be prepared to do one. Do yours first to get the ball rolling, set the tone, and flush out any technical issues with mics, projectors and missing display-port adapters.

*   **Have a plan**

Logistics, sponsors and set-lists. You&rsquo;re now an event organiser. What&rsquo;s the flow? For the London events, we set the start-time half an hour before the first talk. Early birds can grab a drink and chat while others turn up. At 7pm there is a quick intro to the space, the meetup, the talks and what&rsquo;ll happen after. During the first talk, we get food delivered. We break for food and people have something to talk about while they re-fuel.

**Setting up the meetup at Meetup.com**

*   Setting an attendance limit
*   Asking attendees questions during signup

**Deciding what kind of meetup to organize**

*   Speakers? Social gathering? Live coding?
*   Deciding how many people to aim for
*   Finding speakers
*   Finding out what kind of people are coming
*   If you are planning to give a talk about Meteor, here are some talks by Meteor founders/ core developers that you may find valuable. Feel free to incorporate any material from these into your own talk. You can find many more on the <u>[Meteor YouTube channel](http://videos.meteor.com)</u>.:

    *   <u>[Naomi Seyfer’s Meteor 101 at Devshop 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSAKFkxq4jA)</u>
    *   <u>[Geoff Schmidt&rsquo;s DjangoCon Keynote](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34_oKFx43O4&amp;feature=colike)</u>
    *   <u>[Matt DeBergalis&rsquo; Html5DevConf talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpp-8gkPWVE)</u>
    *   <u>[Matt DeBergalis&rsquo; RealtimeConf talk](http://2012.realtimeconf.com/video/matt-debergalis)</u>
    *   <u>[Avital Oliver&rsquo;s Google Hangout](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq9tA6jdDSA&amp;feature=youtu.be)</u>
    *   <u>[David Greenspan&rsquo;s CascadiaJS talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=kZumPtYMR3Y)</u>
    *   <u>[Matt DeBergalis&rsquo; Schmonference Conf talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSmbdVIWgs8)</u>
    *   Also check out the excellent <u>[LXJS Meteor workshop](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFiLPpTKK-I)</u> by London co-captain Oli Evans.
    *   if your attendees are mostly people who are not very familiar with Meteor, the first meetup could be as simple as introductions, followed by a viewing of the <u>[original screencast](http://www.meteor.com/screencast)</u> or <u>[Naomi’s Meteor 101](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSAKFkxq4jA)</u>, followed by discussion/socializing
    *   if you (or someone you know) feels up for it, a “deploy your first Meteor app” workshop led by a live facilitator is often popular and well-received
    *   if some percentage of your attendees have deployed Meteor apps before (even simple ones), a basic “show and tell” format can work very well - people take turns giving short ~5 min demos of what they’re working on, followed by open Q&amp;A, coworking, and socializing. As long as you have members writing Meteor apps, this format can be repeated indefinitely.
    *   The <u>[SF Meteor meetup](http://www.meetup.com/meteor-sfbay)</u> holds an event called “Devshop” every month at Meteor HQ, typically on the last Thursday. The evening tech talks and lightning talks are <u>[streamed live](http://devshop.meteor.com/)</u> starting 7pm PST, and you can ask the speakers questions by tweeting #MeteorDevshop. Hosting a “Devshop watching party” makes for an easy, repeatable event format. If 7pm PST isn’t timezone-convenient for you, you can hold it the day after; the livestream link is still viewable for at least 24 hours after the event is over.&nbsp;
    *   the authors of the excellent <u>[Discover Meteor](http://www.discovermeteor.com/)</u> ebook do outreach to Meteor meetup groups and can help you hold a <u>[Discover Meteor event](http://www.discovermeteor.com/meetups)</u>, featuring a Meteor quiz (with free book to the winner) and a Skype session with one of the authors
    *   <u>[Chris Mather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWJ8LIzQMHY)</u> (<u>[EventedMind](http://eventedmind.com)</u>) and <u>[Ritik Malhotra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfFGjmiKfnA)</u> (<u>[Streem.io](http://streem.io)</u>) are happy to do a 30 min Q&amp;A Google Hangout with meetup groups. Perhaps the meetup would enjoy watching one of their talks, followed by a Q&amp;A with the speaker.
    *   Josh Owens ([Blog](http://joshowens.me/)) is happy to do a Q&amp;A Google Hangout.

*   Shortly after the 1.0 release in late 2014, I’m sure many Meteorites may have questions for core devs. Please email <u>[community@meteor.com](mailto:community@meteor.com)</u>, and we can possibly coordinate a Q&amp;A with a core dev.&nbsp;

**Finding a venue**

*   Sponsors
*   Consider looking at other local tech groups and who is sponsoring/providing venue for them (e.g., who&rsquo;s sponsoring meetups for Docker, as they regularly have other sponsors).
*   Make sure the venue has decent WiFi
*   Consider holding your meetup somewhere that developers already congregate. Does your city have a local <u>[hackerspace](http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/)</u> or a technical university? If your city has a MongoDB office, they are often happy to host Meteor meetups as well.&nbsp; Github has an even more formalized tech event <u>[sponsorship program](https://community.github.com/)</u>. If you find out about more, please email the <u>[captain’s list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/meteor-captains)</u> to let other organizers know.
*   ambient noise level: can people hear each other speak?
*   make sure there are non-alcoholic beverages available and that your venue does not bar those below legal drinking age from attending

    *   if there’s a young talented coder, he/she should be able to attend, regardless of legal drinking age in your country

**Maximizing turnout**

*   announce event 2.5, preferably 3 weeks in advance
*   start with event capacity &lt; 0.5 actual capacity, and increase it over time
*   if it’s not your first event:

    *   schedule your next event pretty soon (maybe within a week) of your last event when it’s fresh in people’s minds
    *   ask the room at the end of your event whether this is a good day of the week for them (possibly surface any recurring conflicting tech events in the area)

*   make sure to enable the waitlist feature
*   if you belong to any relevant mailing lists and related meetup groups, promote your Meteor event to them (without being spammy, of course). Examples: university mailing lists, JavaScript meetup groups, MongoDB meetup groups, web developer meetup groups.&nbsp;
*   tweet about your event to @meteorjs or e-mail <u>[community@meteor.com](mailto:community@meteor.com)</u>. Jade and Alice can help promote your event via the @meteorjs twitter account and other channels
*   if promoting on twitter, links and other important event info should fit in &lt;140 characters even _after_ retweeting (i.e. “RT @yourtwitterhandle: text here”) Otherwise, this info may be truncated.
*   if your event centers around demos and/or talks, try to get at least one person to commit in advance to demoing/talking and put it in the event description to entice RSVPs
*   you can usually expect about half the number who RSVP to actually show. This is normal; plan accordingly when arranging for refreshments, etc

**Diversity as a priority**

*   Getting more women to your meetup
*   Getting more ethnic diversity at your meetup
*   Other forms of diversity?
*   Rough codes of conduct

*   If there are local women coder study groups or meetup groups (e.g. “Women Who Code” group in SF), try to cross-post about 1.5-2 days prior to main announcement (note: meetup’s default option is to send out the initial announcement)

    *   personalize invite emails to developers who are minorities or women
    *   there are major cultural differences that emerge between 2% female and 20% female (diversity should not be a last-minute coat of paint)
    *   have shirts in women’s sizes on hand (_not_ just babydoll sizes)

*   another advantage to starting with a ‘low’ event capacity: preferentially let women, minorities, and students in from the waitlist in advance
*   if someone looks shy/uncomfortable/alone/quiet, make a point to talk to them and introduce them to a new friend or two
*   <u>[CMU tips for diversity at hackathons](https://plus.google.com/u/0/100523810376335283165/posts/NJKcmsB99Aa)</u>

**Advertising your meetup**

*   Find other similar meetup groups and go talk at their meetups if it&rsquo;s allowed, it could come of as steeling people from their group.
*   Find Facebook groups/pages and get them to promote it
*   We got plenty of people from my old programme Interaction Design by posting a link on their page.
*   Mail people you know, maybe someone with contacts/mailing lists to people at your old School or something similar.
*   We got a couple of people up by me mailing the responsible at the Computer Science Bachelor program at Chalmers, he was happy to send it through to a couple people, I can&rsquo;t wait for him to get the courage to add it to their massive mailing list that goes to both new and old people at the program.
*   Facebook ads?
*   Just putting it out there, could be an idea.. I&rsquo;ve used it with great success for small running competitions
*   Mailchimp -- I&rsquo;d love a better designed mail than that of the standard Meetup.
*   Meetup doesn&rsquo;t do its job to get people to coming back and also there&rsquo;s no statistics on how many read the mail, as well as how many clicked links in the mail.
*   Yeah, Meetup has lists that you can email to in order to send to the group, so I guess you could use those as the recipient in MailChimp...although not quite sure how to add it to the list without double opt-in (which implies an email sent to the whole group). Is it within MailChimp&rsquo;s policies to just add it?

## Running a meetup

**Setting up beforehand**

*   Screensharing/presenting, lighting, microphones, etc

**Your job as a Captain during the meetup**

<TODO>

*   &nbsp;Never knew it was so easy! :P

**What to put on slides**

*   Estimating the knowledge level of your audience
*   Where people can look for more info about Meteor
*   Homework
*   Thank sponsors, speakers &amp; organising team

**How to live code a Meteor app**

<TODO>

**Best practices for handling lightning talks or talks by speakers**

*   Live streaming a remote speaker

**Fun things to do as a group**

*   take a group picture (or a few). Post them to G+, or tweet them and mention @meteorjs&nbsp;
*   write to us at <u>[community@meteor.com](mailto:community@meteor.com)</u> and tell us how the meetup went!
*   encourage others to take pictures, exchange contact information, friend each other, etc
*   post about interesting apps people show to G+/twitter/etc.
*   everyone gets stickers

**Winding down with a social event**

<TODO>

## After the meetup

**Reaching out to attendees for feedback**

*   Keep your eye out for attendees who might be interested in helping to organize. The best run meetups often have more than one organizer.
*   encourage people to write blog entries on how-to-make-the-app-you-just-made, even if they’re trivial, because doing the same thing in non-Meteor is often nontrivial

**Identifying key attendees**

<TODO>

**Planning the next meetup**

*   Making the next one even better
*   Finding the right size
*   Advancing the knowledge level

*   Have had lots of difficulties finding a great approach for this as there&rsquo;s always new people coming in.
*   Agreed. One thing I was planning on doing was a workshop-style meetup exclusive for people with Meteor experience where we tackle building a specific app or something together. Has anyone done something like this?
*   I don&rsquo;t think you need to label it as advanced. I&rsquo;ve done live coding style events and just let everyone watch. No matter what level they are people walk away learning things by watching someone code.
*   Agree with [Josh Owens](/ep/profile/Fsu2rTcN8Hu) on that. Highlighting something as advanced puts more people off than it attracts and people of all levels benefit from seeing other people code.
*   As much as possible try and start each meetup with a beginner friendly demo / talk. After that, try and mix up the simple and more advanced talks. In reality, you typically have little control over other peoples talks, so be prepared at each event to give a talk aimed at a level that isn&rsquo;t covered by the others. If all the talks are beginner friendly, do a deep dive, and vice-versa.

*   Asking RSVPs to do homework
*   Announcing the next meetup when it&rsquo;s fresh in your attendees&rsquo; minds

**Keeping in touch with other Captains and MDG**

*   Joining and participating in the Google Group
